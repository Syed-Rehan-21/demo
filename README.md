## Hands-On Scenario
### Task 1: Implement a feature collaboratively using branches.

- You: Create a feature branch feature/add-readme, add a README.md, commit, push, and create a PR.
- Your Friend: Reviews your PR, requests changes, and you update the branch accordingly.
- You: After approval, merge into main and delete the branch.
- Your Friend: Pulls the updated main branch.

### Task 2: Merge:

- You create a feature/add-footer branch and commit changes.
- Your friend creates feature/add-header and commits changes.
- You both merge your branches into main, resolving any conflicts together.

### Task 3: Rebase:
- You and your friend both work on different branches (feature/one and feature/two).
- One of you merges first into main.
- The other rebases their branch onto the updated main, resolving conflicts if necessary.
