 A. Create a numpy array called arr7 using the method arange. The starting value of this array is 120 and ending value is 999, with a step size of 30. Use the linspace method to create another array called arr8, where the starting value is 12 and ending value is 99 and which contains 500 evenly spaced elements.
```python
import numpy as np

# Create arr7 using arange
arr7 = np.arange(120, 999, 30)

# Create arr8 using linspace
arr8 = np.linspace(12, 99, 500)

# Display arr7 and arr8
print("arr7:")
print(arr7)
print("\narr8:")
print(arr8)
```

B. Implement an ANN on the Diabetes dataset with 3 hidden layers, each with 5 neurons.
```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load the Diabetes dataset
diabetes_data = pd.read_csv('diabetes.csv')

# Split the dataset into features (X) and target variable (y)
X = diabetes_data.drop('Outcome', axis=1)
y = diabetes_data['Outcome']

# Split the dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Standardize the features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)

# Create an MLPClassifier with 3 hidden layers, each with 5 neurons
mlp = MLPClassifier(hidden_layer_sizes=(5, 5, 5), max_iter=1000, random_state=42)

# Train the model
mlp.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict on the test set
y_pred = mlp.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
```
